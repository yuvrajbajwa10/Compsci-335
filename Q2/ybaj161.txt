I think the Quiz was pretty good. But its is too much effort to get 100% grade. I think the course does not prepare a student well enough by it self, such that a student will get full marks. It took me 10 hrs to do this quiz with 1 hr break. I was done with the other tasks in 1 hrs from starting, but task 2 takes too much effort to complete.
